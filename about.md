Piotr Migdał, PhD - freelancing in data analysis, machine learning and interactive visualization (a "data scientist", to put it fashionably).

I am available for consulting and contract work, worldwide/remotely. Generally, I am not looking for a full-time job.

Originally from [Bielsko-Biała](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a) (southern Poland). Alumnus of the University of Warsaw (Phys + Maths), [KFnrD](http://crastina.se/gifted-children-in-poland-by-piotr-migdal/) and [RSI2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Science_Institute).

Dedicated to education of gifted schoolchildren and organization of bottom-up activities. In free time enjoys photography, hiking and coding. Dreams about revolutionizing how science and education are being done. Loves good e-mails.
