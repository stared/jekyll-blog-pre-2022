## Why a blog?

I decided to start a blog. I am not new to writing things - just this time I want to have my place for it. (Very likely I will continue to do cuckoo-style blog posting.)

## Why Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static page generator. It's supported by GitHub, so there is no extra effort in starting or maintaining it. And:

* I like [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
* I like [GitHub](https://github.com/stared).
* I like simplicity. (And I don't need fancy features.)
* Yet, I want to configure some stuff.
* I use LaTeX and I want to be able to use any HTML code (SVG diagrams, [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) visualizations...).
* I am concerned about archiving things in plain formats.
* I want to avoid distractions. (By editing in a text editor - [Atom](https://atom.io/).)
* Git commits gamify my efforts. (Seriously!)

My site [migdal.wikidot.com](http://migdal.wikidot.com/) is probably staying (at least - for some time). But for the further texts I prefer something cleaner, simpler.

*  How to include LaTeX (via MathJaX) [peeking at Karpathy's blog]( https://github.com/karpathy/karpathy.github.io/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mathjax) (a proof that it works: $$\exp(i \pi) + 1 = 0$$)

## What's going there?

I have in mind some entires on data science, academia and education. Also, I want to:

* **blogify emails** I am resending over and over (book reviews, collections of links, pieces of advice),
* **archive** my post scattered over various places,
* **translate** some Polish posts into English.

## How often do I want to post?

I make no claims. But expect more of a "once a few months" than anything more frequent.

## I see typoes and erorrs

So, raise an [issue](https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io/issues) or even submit a [pull request](https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io/pulls). In general, code for posts is [here](https://github.com/stared/stared.github.io/tree/master/_posts).
