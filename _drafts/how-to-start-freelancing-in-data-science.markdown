One of question I get a lot is "how to become a data science freelancer?". The short answer is "I don't know". Since it never satisfied anyone, well, let me share a few things I've learnt in the process.


## How do I get contracts?

In the last 2.5 years all of my contracts were because someone contacted me. There were various routes, the most common were:

* past employees / contractors,
* through network of friends (since my friends know that I do data sci consulting),
* discovering me due to my GitHub projects and blog posts.

Getting to that point is tricky. It took me about 1 year.


## Can I freelance?

Freelancing is not for everyone. It gives freedom and flexibility: about project you choose and time in which you work. But it comes at a cost of stability and safety. A lot of decisions (which projects to take? what to learn? )

You will never see a paycheck just because a month ended.

> [...] the on-demand economy clearly imposes more risk on individuals. People will have to master multiple skills if they are to survive in such a world—and keep those skills up to date. Professional sorts in big service firms will have to take more responsibility for educating themselves. People will also have to learn how to sell themselves, through personal networking and social media or, if they are really ambitious, turning themselves into brands. In a more fluid world, everybody will need to learn how to manage You Inc.

You don't have boss. It's a blessing and a curse. While the first may be self-evident, let's me focus on the later.

You need to be your own pushy asshole boss, and your lazy employe at the same time.

## Being unique

In freelancing you need to negotiate your price from project to project. Some love it, most not.

I have my baseline price per hour.


Key parts:

* for mid-longer projects it should be 2-3x as if for full-time employment,
* for single hours, or hours scattered in your calendar - much more.

As a freelancer your billable hours do not cover:

* sick leave,
* holidays,
* accounting,
* marketing,
* speaking at conferences,
* developing long-term skills,
* meeting with potential clients.

The crucial part is to estimate your billable hours per month.
